<h1>On Talking</h1>

<p>Talking.</p>

<p>In the beginning stages, one always treads cautiously. One prefers to test the waters by broaching pretty insignificant topics. Who should be the next Prime minister of India? What is god? What is life? How does Mahesh Babu manage to look so young?</p>

<p>Based on the answers you might take a liking to that person. You might get comfortable with them. You might feel elated that you finally have a person with whom you can share your thoughts. Strings of free-flowing thoughts that you are passionate about; spent countless hours on.</p>

<p>Slowly, one by one you let go of them. Is everything all right between Ranbir and Alia? Who do you think Prabhas should marry? Why is no one telling Virat not to go for the fifth stump off-side balls? My guess is he is surrounded by a bunch of yes-men. There is one aunty who is obsessed with my neighbors, who are recently married. I hate aunties so much. So invasive they are. Also, did I tell you why I think not everything is good between Alia and Ranbir? What could be the salary of Ambani’s watchman? Is intermediate qualification enou-</p>

<p>Then once you make your bond of friendship official, once you let everyone know that you now have a new best friend, you get into serious and important stuff, the nitty gritties of life. How the third cousin from your mom’s side is hitting on you and how much you’d like to hit him in the face. Remember that guy I told you about. Yeah turns out he is a creep. Doesn’t look like one though. Appearances can be deceiving, I have learned that spending time with you. Can you believe it my mom actually wants me to concentrate on my studies. Studying is so overrated yeaaa! One should think out of the box. And I’m thinking of joining as Ambani’s watchman.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<p>When I say that the topics of government, god, and life are insignificant, I mean it. No its not an attempt at humour. It’s the truth. Now please put down your pitchforks so that I can explain.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter anymore in which god you believe. Since you don’t have to worry about throwing yourself in fire cause your husband died or dread the day your husband might get rid of you by merely repeating a word three times (wait, that still happens.)</p>

<p>“What is life?” A question so elusive it led to the creation of countless religions and the pursuit of many sciences over the centuries. We as humans have finally found a way to cope with this question. And that is to completely ignore the question by distracting our brain with a myriad of distractions (by which I really mean Instagram and TikTok). So that before our mind could even frame half the question something else grabs our attention.</p>

<p>As for who runs the government? Does it really affect us? Us normal citizens? I don’t think so. The newly elected government is always preoccupied with blaming the previous government. Claiming the previous government did not do anything. But strangely enough, complain that everything they have done reeks of corruption. Come on, decide on one thing. And by the time they are done bitching about the ex-cabinet their term is over. The changing government’s impact could range from you not having enough job opportunities to you dying in a communal riot. Communal violence? That’s just an extreme possibility.</p>

<p>It’s happening in Bangladesh currently. It’s our neighbour country. At least there is no one in our country trying their best to raise communal tensions so that they can stay in power for a bit longer and bitch about ex-government. What? We have been the ruling party for the past three terms? Ok, let’s bitch about what the opposition have done four decades ago. Our Indian political parties are such aunties.</p>

<p>Compared to that if you actually slap your third cousin it may lead to real immediate consequences. Your mom victim blaming you.</p>

<p>Leave it to moms to practice patriarchy. For no one can do it better than them.</p>

<p>Men are good at destroying things at best. If you want to sustain or maintain something you entrust it to a woman. One of few intelligent males of ancient history had done the same with patriarchy. And would you look at it? It surpassed so many generations and is still going strong.</p>

<p>As for working as Ambani’s watchman, call me whatever you want, that’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Only a fool would say no to it.</p>

<div class="divider"></div>

<p>And that’s how you create a bond. And I have a few too.</p>

<p>And just because of that, I would like to think of myself as an achiever.</p>

<p>And I intend to do the same here. Create a bond (only if you are willing) by having a chat about me or society or history. I don’t get to see your face and you don’t get to see mine, yes. (It is a blessing for you, trust me.) But I think I can do it.</p>

<p>P.S. Please don’t tell my dad I called myself an achiever. He would create a blog just to write a hundred reasons why I (his son) is a loser and would do so in much less time than it took me to type the first Hi in this blog.</p>
